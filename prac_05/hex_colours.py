CP1404 Practical instructions:
Create a program that allows you to:
- Look up hexadecimal colour codes like those at http://www.color-hex.com/color-names.html
- Use a constant dictionary of about 10 colour names
- User to enter a name and get the code, e.g. entering AliceBlue should show #f0f8ff.
- Entering an invalid colour name should not crash.
- Allow the user to enter names until they enter a blank one to stop the loop
